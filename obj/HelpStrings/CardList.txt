Type: "!bingo cardlist " plus the following:

view: prints a list of the active cards for this date and version, with index.

"reset 6": resets card 6 from the list above. This means that the user will receive a new card, i.e. new entries, when they rerequest one, or when a mod reissues changed cards. The indexes will reset after you've deleted an entry, so if you are deleting multiple, ensure you view the list again in between. 

"reset all": resets all active cards, so users can rerequest a new card. 

"reissue": this reissues cards to users with ammended cards via DM.
