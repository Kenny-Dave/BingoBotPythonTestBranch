To manipulate the bingo list:

	Bingo list entries cannot contain the following: <, >, "Free", ", '. < will be changed to "[", ">" to "]".  " and ' will be removed. "Free" will be changed to "Free square".

	"!bingo list view"
		Print list in thread with index. Index can be used with commands below. 

	"!bingo list output"
		This does the same as view, but attaches the list as a file. If there are many changes, you may wish to download this, amend it, then reupload using replacelist. 
		
	"!bingo list replacelist <file>"
		This will replace the entire list with the entries in an attached file.
		Please be careful with this. 
		The file should be a text file, and have one line per bingo entry. 
		If it starts with a number and a fullstop, e.g. "20. It's all chat's fault", then the number and full stop will be removed. So you can download, ammend and reupload without worrying about formatting. 

	"!bingo list add "example""
		This adds an entry to the bingo list, called "example".
		
	"!bingo list remove n"
		This removes the bingo list entry numbered n. Use the view command to see the numbered list. 
		Note that the numbering will reset with changes after the date or version is changed, or the sort command. 
		
	"!bingo list change n """
		Changes the text of the n item. 
		
	"!bingo list sort"
		This resorts and reindexes the bingo list.
